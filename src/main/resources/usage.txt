        Number          -   for <minutes>, valid values are any digits from 0 to 59 (both inclusive)

                            for <day-of-week>, valid values are any digits from 0 to 7 (both inclusive)

        * (all)         –   used to specify that the command should be executed for every time unit
                            example: "*" in the <minute> field – means "for every minute"

        – (range)       –   used to determine the value range
                            example: "10-11" in <hour> field means "10th and 11th hours"

        , (values)      –   used to specify multiple values
                            example: "1,5" in <day-of-week> field means on 1st and 5th day of the week

        / (increments)  –   used to specify the incremental values
                            example: a "5/15" in the <minute> field means at "5, 20, 35 and 50 minutes of an hour"

    Example:
        $ java -jar target/cron-expr-parser-0.9-jar-with-dependencies.jar \*/15 0 1,15 \* 1-5 /bin/ls -a

    Note: If you use special characters such as '*', your terminal may interpret them and expand them before sending
          them to the program as command line arguments. To solve this problem, consider escaping special characters
          by prefixing them with a backslash ('\') similar to the example shown above.
